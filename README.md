# LumenHealth 🩺✨

**LumenHealth** is a lightweight, AI-assisted electronic medical record (EMR) system built for clinics, mobile health teams, and care providers operating in resource-constrained or low-connectivity environments. It prioritizes speed, clarity, and reliability over bloated hospital software.

At its core, LumenHealth combines **AI-powered clinical intelligence** with **secure, blockchain-based payments** to support both care delivery and sustainability.

## What Makes LumenHealth Different

* **AI-assisted clinical workflows:** Uses Google Gemini to generate visit summaries, assist documentation, and surface key clinical insights without replacing clinician judgment.
* **Offline-friendly by design:** Built to function in environments with unstable or intermittent connectivity.
* **Lightweight EMR, not a hospital ERP:** Focused on essential patient records and encounters, not administrative overload.
* **Crypto-native payments:** Enables fast, low-cost payments via the Stellar network, supporting clinics without access to traditional banking.
* **Open-source & extensible:** Designed to be adapted for NGOs, startups, and public health pilots.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

LumenHealth is a **Monorepo** managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) and NPM Workspaces. This allows us to share configuration, types, and logic between the frontend, backend, and blockchain services.

| Layer | Technology | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Monorepo Tooling** | Turborepo / NPM | Orchestration and workspace management |
| **Frontend** | Next.js (React) | Clinic dashboard and patient management UI |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | REST API using a **Modular Monolith** architecture |
| **Blockchain** | Stellar SDK | Payment processing and access control service |
| **Database** | MongoDB | Off-chain storage for patient data and logs |
| **AI Layer** | Google Gemini | Clinical summarization and intelligence |

## Repository Structure

The project is divided into **Apps** (deployable services) and **Packages** (shared libraries).

```

### Backend Internal Structure (`apps/api`)

The API follows a **Modular Monolith** pattern. Code is organized by domain, not just technical layer.

* `modules/auth`: Users, roles, sessions (JWT)
* `modules/patients`: Patient demographics & lookup
* `modules/encounters`: The core append-only medical history
* `modules/payments`: Subscription & Stellar payment logic
* `modules/ai`: Gemini prompt management

---

## API Design (High-Level)

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`

### Patients

* `POST /patients` - Create new record
* `GET /patients/:id` - Retrieve patient details

### Clinical Encounters

* `POST /encounters` - Log a new visit
* `GET /encounters/:id` - View visit details
* `GET /encounters/patient/:patientId` - Full history

### Payments (Stellar)

* `POST /payments/intent` - Generate payment request
* `POST /payments/confirm` - Verify on-chain transaction

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **npm** (v10+ recommended)
* **MongoDB** (Local or Atlas URL)
* **Google Gemini API Key**
* **Stellar Testnet Account**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Monorepo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lumen-health.git
cd lumen-health

```


2. **Install Dependencies (Root)**
This installs dependencies for *all* apps and packages at once.
```bash
npm install

```


3. **Environment Setup**
Create a **single** `.env` file in the **root** directory. The `packages/config` module will distribute these variables to all apps.
```bash
cp .env.example .env

```


**Example `.env`:**
```env
API_PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lumenhealth
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

```



### Running Locally

To start **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Services** simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev

```

* **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
* **Backend:** [http://localhost:4000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:4000)

### Running Individual Workspaces

If you only want to work on one part of the system:

```bash
npm run dev -w apps/api       # Run only Backend
npm run dev -w apps/web       # Run only Frontend

```

## Contributing

LumenHealth is open-source. We welcome contributions from engineers, designers, and healthcare technologists.

### Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3. **Commit** your changes.
4. **Push** to the branch.
5. **Open a Pull Request**.

### Guidelines

* **Respect the Monorepo:** Ensure you are installing dependencies via the root `package.json` or using `npm install <pkg> -w apps/<app-name>`.
* **Strict Types:** We use TypeScript. Please avoid `any` wherever possible.
* **Patient Privacy:** Never include real patient data in tests or screenshots.
